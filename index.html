  <p> Amid ongoing waves of legislation targeting the rights of LGBTQ individuals across the country, New York state has been regarded as a safe state. The state has enacted laws like the Sexual Non-Discrimination Act (SONDA) in 2003 and the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act (GENDA) in 2019,  which prohibit any kind of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity or expression, according to the New York State Attorney General’s office.
</p>

<p>But recent data demonstrates that LGBTQ+ New Yorkers continue to face bias-related violence. The New York Division of Criminal Justice Services <em>Hate Crimes by County and Bias Type</em> data, last updated in Nov. 2023, tracks reported hate crimes across the state from 2010 to the present. Under the <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/485.05">New York Hate Crimes Act</a>, hate crimes are defined as offenses committed based on the victim’s perceived or actual identity, including race, religion, sexual orientation and gender identity.

<p> From 2019 to 2022, gay men were the most frequent targets of LGBTQ hate crimes in New York State, according to the data from the New York Division of Criminal Justice Services. During each year, the number of hate crimes committed against gay men exceeded those of other subgroups. Hate crimes against gay men occurred at least three times more often than transgender individuals and over 10 times as often as lesbians. Even in 2020, when hate crimes against all groups saw a decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic, gay men were still victimized more often than these other groups. 
 </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019">FBI Hate Crime Statistics</a>, in 2019, gay men were the most targeted group in LGBTQ hate crimes nationwide, a trend consistent with New York’s state-level numbers. These numbers continued to rise in 2021 and surpassed 100 incidents in 2022. Crimes against lesbians and transgender people remained comparatively lower. </p>

<p> <br><br>Anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes across New York state are reported at the highest rate in a combination of both urban and rural counties according to the New York Division of Criminal Justice Services data. New York City, where the state’s population is most concentrated, contained the most counties with higher hate crime reports. New York County (Manhattan) had both the highest number of crimes reported and the highest per capita rate at about seven hate crimes per 100,000 people. Though still higher than many other regions, Erie, Suffolk, Richmond and Nassau counties shared a lower per capita rate of roughly one hate crime per 100,000 people.<br><br>
The data shows that several upstate counties including Albany and Broome have moderate per capita rates. These regions have more hate crimes per capita than places such as Kings County (Brooklyn) despite having significantly smaller populations.
 </p>

</div>

<p> According to the New York Division of Criminal Justice Services data, anti-LGBTQ hate crimes fluctuated from 2015 to 2022, with an overall uptick in recent years. Crimes against every group except for lesbians during this period.
 </p>

<p> Between 2016 and 2017, reported hate crimes against gay men, lesbians and transgender individuals declined. While the numbers of anti-gay female hate crimes remained relatively steady for the next five years, anti-gay male and anti-transgender hate crimes rose sharply and continued to climb through 2022 following a dip during the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>

<p> Similar patterns emerged nationally during this time, along with larger national issues. In 2021, the <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/2021-officially-becomes-worst-year-in-recent-history-for-lgbtq-state-legislative-attacks-as-unprecedented-number-of-states-enact-record-shattering-number-of-anti-lgbtq-measures-into-law">Human Rights Campaign</a> reported it was “the worst year for anti-LGBTQ legislation in recent history” with 250 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced  and 17 signed into law by May. The most alarming year prior to this was 2015 with 15 bills signed, according to the Human Rights Campaign. In early 2022, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/nearly-240-anti-lgbtq-bills-filed-2022-far-targeting-trans-people-rcna20418">NBC News</a> reported that almost 240 anti-LGBTQ had been filed so far. And while hate crimes against gay men and lesbians in New York State rose by 9% and 11%, respectively, from 2021 to 2022, nationally, hate crimes based on sexual orientation increased by 13.8% during the same period, according to the Human Rights Campaign.
